# File system test

> this is a work in progress project, please, do not judge that hard, pal

This is a university project, which is supposed to be the final project of my 'file' data structure course. This project is a implementation of a B-TREE and some useful utils for file handling in C. The idea is to create a fast, yet not perfect defined, file system, using file header record, b-tree impl and io buffers for file reading.


## Testing

You will need cmake:
``` bash

mkdir target
cd target
cmake ..
make
./file-system.test

```
